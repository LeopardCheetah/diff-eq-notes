This subsection focuses on equations of the form 

$$\matr{x'} = \matr{A}\matr{x}$$ 

where $\matr{A}$ is a $n \times n$ matrix of real-valued constants.

\vspace{0.2cm}

Assuming\footnote{Some stuff about a phase portrait/plane is talked about here although those tools are primarily used for visualization purposes.} $\matr{x} = \xi e^{rt}$, after substituting it into the above equation, we eventually derive the equation 

$$(\matr{A} - r\matr{I})\xi = 0\text{,}$$

which means solutions to $\matr{x}$ are given pairs of eigenvalue-eigenvector combinations $(r, \xi)$. When $\matr{A}$ is specifically a $2 \times 2$ matrix, if the eigenvalues of $\matr{A}$ have opposite signs, then the origin is a saddle point and an unstable equilibrium. If on the other hand, the eigenvalues of $\matr{A}$ have the same sign, then the origin is a \textbf{node} and $\matr{0}$ is a stable equlibrium if the eigenvalues are negative and unstable if the eigenvalues are positive.

Returning to the more general case of when $\matr{A}$ is a $n \times n$ matrix, the eigenvalues of $\matr{A}$ ($r_1$, $r_2$, $\dots$, $r_n$) can either be 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item all real and different from one another,
    \item some eigenvalues are complex conjugate pairs of each other, or 
    \item some eigenvalues are repeated.
\end{enumerate}

The first case is easy to take care of; if all $n$ eigenvalues are real and different, then their corresponding eigenvectors ($\xi^{(i)}$) will all be linearly independent and as such $\matr{x} = c_1\xi^{(1)}e^{r_1t} + \cdots + c_n\xi^{(n)}e^{r_nt}$. Section 7.6 deals with case two, of when some eigenvalues are complex conjugate pairs of each other. Section 7.8 deals with the case of repeated eigenvalues.

Remember: To find eigenvalues, solve the characteristic polynomial $\det(\matr{A} - r\matr{I}_n) = 0$, and to get the corresponding eigenvectors, RREF $\matr{A} - r\matr{I}_n$ for a given $r$.

    7. After finding our eigenvalues to be $r = \{4, -1, 1\}$ and the associated eigenvectors to be $\xi = \{[1 \ 1 \ 1]^T, [1 \ 0 \ -1]^T, [-1 \ 2 \ -1]^T\}$, we conclude that $\matr{x} = c_1\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}e^{4t} + c_2\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ -1\end{pmatrix}e^{-t} + c_3\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}e^t$ for arbitrary constants $c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$.

    8. This is a nice symmetric matrix with eigenvalues. Solving, we eventually find the characteristic polynomial to be $(\lambda - 8)(\lambda + 1)(\lambda + 1) = 0$ which means the corresponding eigenvaues are $\lambda = r = 8, -1$. Solving for eigenvectors and plugging them in, we find $\matr{x} = c_1\begin{pmatrix}
        -1 \\ 2 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix} e^{-t} + c_2 \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\ 2 \\ -1 
    \end{pmatrix} e^{-t} + c_3 \begin{pmatrix}
        2 \\ 1 \\ 2
    \end{pmatrix}e^{8t}$.
